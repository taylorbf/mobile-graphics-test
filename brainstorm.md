## More pages:

- SVG w/ animation





Testing SVG ability --

- Waveform (repeating black squares) with translucent overlay that can be moved
  - How is its speed of motion on mobile?
- very large grid of toggles that can each be turned on and off
  - use a loop
  - this simulates having tons of nexusUI widgets on a page
  - does the processing slow down at all?

If all goes well, then
- Try an SVG dial to see how it looks
  - non interactive, even -- just a circle
